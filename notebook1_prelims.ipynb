    "\n",

    "\n",
    "If $|B\\rangle$ denotes a bit state, the least significant bit (LSb) in $|B\\rangle$ is the output bit. This is the right-most bit in $|B\\rangle$. The new state $|B^\\prime\\rangle$ is then determined as follows. The tap positions in the LFSR single out a collection of bits in $|B\\rangle$. These are then XOR'd (i.e., added as elements in $\\mathbb Z_2$) and appended to the *most* significant bit position (MSb) in $|B\\rangle$. This is the left-most bit. After then dropping the LSb, we arrive at the new bit state $|B^\\prime\\rangle$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Illustration.** Consider $|B\\rangle = 10110$. This can be transformed by an LFSR of degree `5`. Consider tap positions at `3` and `4`. See that $\\mathrm{LSb}(|B\\rangle) = 0$. This is the first output of the LFSR. To construct the new bit state $|B^\\prime\\rangle$, firstly drop this LSb. The bits at positions `3` and `4` in $|B\\rangle$ are `1` and `0`. XORing these gives `1` which is now appended to the MSb position, yielding the new bit state \n",
