# Linear feedback shift registers

## Library and notebooks

In this repository please find a package for studying Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) at `lfsr_library`. 
This is accompanied by Jupyter notebooks, serving as ad hoc documentation, demonstrating classes and methods from the `lfsr_library` package.

You can view these notebooks with Jupyter's online notebook viewer at the links below.
